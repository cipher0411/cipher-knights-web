      <h2>What is Penetration Testing?</h2>
      <p>This is a systematic and controlled cybersecurity assessment process conducted by skilled professionals to simulate cyberattacks on a computer system, network, or application. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that malicious hackers could exploit. Penetration testing helps organizations proactively strengthen their security measures by pinpointing potential points of entry and vulnerabilities, allowing them to patch and secure their systems effectively.</p>
