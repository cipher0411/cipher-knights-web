            <p>Healthcare cyber security has changed dramatically in the last ten years with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) devices increasing on the medical network. IoT technologies are rapidly becoming part of the high-tech medical arena. Medical devices are now connected to the network in order to help doctors, nurses, and support teams provide critical care services for patients. The new interconnected device types are not always managed in the same way as traditional IT systems. They are often left unpatched and vulnerable to attack. This uncontrolled environment leaves hospitals and other medical service providers accepting great levels of risk in order to improve services.

              At Cyber Security Services, we understand this risk. We help healthcare organizations succeed by reducing that risk by improving the security of network connected devices. This includes everything from medical equipment to security devices. We take a proactive approach to getting an accurate inventory and applying a risk assessment model to determine areas that should be prioritized for improved security controls.
              
              There were 339 healthcare organizations breached in 2017 alone. It is important to partner with an organization that understands the unique risks facing healthcare today. Cyber Security Services has been helping some of the largest hospitals in the United States solve some of those challenges adipiscing elit.</p>
